## Minimax Algorithm with Helper Functions

In the implementation of the minimax algorithm and its variations, I've opted to create two helper functionsâ€”one for Pacman and one for the ghosts. These functions call one another, contributing to a cleaner and more straightforward code structure.

### Evaluation Functions

The evaluation functions employed in the algorithm exhibit significant similarity. The primary distinction arises in the treatment of successor states: question 1 focuses on examining the successor state, while question 5 involves evaluating the current state.
